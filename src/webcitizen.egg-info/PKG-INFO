This is a work in progress. Function are subject to change.

The goal is to provide a set of utilities to extract information from a web page and perform a set of audits. 

TODO - The audits are based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.

# python-webcitizen-audit
Python library. HTML is the input, a set of audits are performed. Results are returned in a score or detailed score.

This is not a web crawler. You need to provide the HTML content as a string or mention URL, description etc manually while creating an object.
